∞Mint.eth (InfinityMint), a cutting-edge tool designed for developers, designers, and artists seeking to elevate their content through Web3 technology. As a versatile development platform, InfinityMint enables the production of highly-scalable and dynamic Web3 content. For designers, it streamlines the prototyping process for NFT collections and facilitates the creation of unique randomized art with our innovative generation engine. For artists, it empowers the development of an entire decentralized ecosystem of users who can engage with your content, granting you full control over every aspect.

InfinityMint boasts numerous groundbreaking features. It allows for the generation of dynamic NFTs, each with a distinct appearance, on the blockchain with minimal gas consumption. Our novel path and asset system for building generative art on-chain currently powers 50+ Web3 deployments. InfinityMint tokens are supported by a custom ERC721 implementation, unlocking a vast array of features previously thought unattainable without significant EVM updates.

## ♾️
♾Mint.eth development began in 2021 as a result of a successful test of the NFTofME.eth revenue streaming concepts on the Ethereum Name Service. The platform introduced concepts formerly validated in EIP-4337, ERC-6551, and contains alternative implementations of account abstraction as well as accomplishing the use of ERC-721 as a an abstracted wallet capable of containing NFT and ERC-20 tokens - also able to act on its own behalf, and was designed to stream intellectual property controls and the revenues of the object. These concepts first came online on the Rinkeby Testnet in 2021, subsequently the first mainnet type deployment happened on the Polygon EVM in 2022, prior to EIP-4337 and ERC-6551 (May 2023). Our team decided to continue to prove the concept and build deployment protocols prior to submitting, EIP, ENS, and ERC proposals.
All InfinityMint tokens are expandable through our smart contract linker, functioning as wallets capable of holding other NFTs within. Modify the nature of your NFTs post-launch, adding new variations to the generation engine over time, and seamlessly integrate additional contracts to expand InfinityMint's functionality.

InfinityMint unifies essential Web3 technologies while introducing its own innovations to deliver a comprehensive toolkit that accelerates Web3 development in mere minutes. Our mission is to provide a user-friendly experience for creating a diverse array of Web3-oriented content.

This “NFT” is all about utility by creating your very own custom Dynamic NFT minter with contracts you own, code you own and can modify and host anywhere. Create a Dynamic NFT project in minutes with direct connections to a robust tools like the NFT location and authentication service EGPS.eth, or the NFT Avatar unification standard NFTofME.eth, and EADS.eth, a supply side content Web3 network that lets NFTs create there own controls allowing for new ways to allow advertising and sponsorships across your content with fun tools like NFT Stickers, Sponsorship anchors. This also enables new ways to manage and monetize IP with our ERC-721 Wallet Expansion Gem via NFTofMe.eth and many more tools and activations in the future.
