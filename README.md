∞Mint.eth (InfinityMint), a cutting-edge tool designed for developers, designers, and artists seeking to elevate their content through Web3 technology. As a versatile development platform, InfinityMint enables the production of highly-scalable and dynamic Web3 content. For designers, it streamlines the prototyping process for NFT collections and facilitates the creation of unique randomized art with our innovative generation engine. For artists, it empowers the development of an entire decentralized ecosystem of users who can engage with your content, granting you full control over every aspect.

## ♾️ Brief History
♾Mint development began in 2021 as a result of a successful test of the NFTofME.eth revenue streaming concepts on the Ethereum Name Service. The platform introduced concepts formerly validated in EIP-4337, ERC-6551, and contains alternative implementations of account abstraction as well as accomplishing the use of ERC-721 as a an abstracted wallet capable of containing NFT and ERC-20 tokens - also able to act on its own behalf, and was designed to stream intellectual property controls and the revenues of the object. These concepts first came online on the Rinkeby Testnet in 2021, subsequently the first mainnet type deployment happened on the Polygon EVM in 2022, prior to EIP-4337 and ERC-6551 (May 2023). Our team decided to continue to prove the concept and build deployment protocols prior to submitting, EIP, ENS, and ERC proposals.
